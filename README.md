# OIBSIP Internship Project Repository
## Welcome to the OIBSIP Internship Project Repository!


## Project Overview
This repository contains the comprehensive work and key learnings from my data science internship. The project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. Leveraging Python, various data science libraries, and machine learning algorithms, the project showcases practical applications in solving real-world problems through data-driven insights. Explore the code, methodologies, and results to understand the journey from raw data to actionable insights.

## Project Highlights
### 1.Flower Type Prediction using Iris Dataset:
- Implemented machine learning models to predict the types of flowers based on features from the famous Iris dataset.
- Utilized popular classification algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.
- Detailed analysis and visualizations provided to understand the dataset and model performance.
### 2.Car Price Prediction:
- Implemented data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model building.
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict car prices.
- Developed a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting car prices based on model inputs.
### 3.Sales Prediction:
- Built predictive models to forecast sales for products/services.
- Leveraged time-series analysis and regression techniques to generate accurate sales predictions.
- Incorporated external factors and seasonal trends for enhanced forecasting accuracy.
